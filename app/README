    Notes:
        1. In case the BASE_URL is invalid, a toast will pop up
           (quick check- delete the last "/" and run the app)
        2. I didn't write comments because I personally believe
           that if your code is clear enough, There is no need.
           In addition, comments need to be updated every time you change the code.

    Constraints:
        1. Works only on Android os
